# 🤝 Community Testing Program

Help us test Oopsie Daisy on different systems and become part of our quality assurance community!

## 🎯 Why Community Testing Matters

While we have comprehensive automated testing, **real-world validation** on diverse hardware and configurations is invaluable for ensuring Oopsie Daisy works perfectly for everyone.

### **What We Can't Automate**
- Real Windows SmartScreen and UAC experiences  
- Hardware-specific GPU monitoring accuracy
- Different antivirus software interactions
- Various Linux desktop environments
- Diverse hardware configurations
- Network drive and external storage testing

## 🧪 Current Testing Coverage

### **✅ What We Test Automatically**
- **Core Functionality**: Import verification, platform detection
- **GUI Components**: Widget creation, navigation, theming
- **Visual Rendering**: UI scaling, animation, performance  
- **Cross-Platform Simulation**: Mock-based Windows/macOS/Linux testing
- **Build Validation**: Executable creation and basic functionality

### **⚠️ What Needs Manual Testing**
- **User Experience**: SmartScreen bypass, permission flows
- **Hardware Compatibility**: GPU acceleration, temperature monitoring
- **File System Testing**: NTFS, APFS, ext4 recovery accuracy
- **Performance Validation**: Real-world scanning speeds
- **Integration Testing**: Full workflows from scan to recovery
