# Windows Testing Guide

This document outlines how to test Oopsie Daisy on Windows systems without having direct access to Windows.

## ü§ñ Automated Testing (Current)

### **GitHub Actions Windows Testing**
Every release automatically tests on `windows-latest` (Windows Server 2022/2025):

1. **Build Verification**: PyInstaller creates executable successfully
2. **File Structure Test**: Executable exists and has valid PE structure
3. **Dependency Loading**: Core imports load without errors
4. **Functionality Test**: `--test` mode verifies all components

**View test results**: https://github.com/reshdesu/oopsie-daisy/actions

### **Test Mode Usage**
Run without GUI to verify functionality:
```cmd
OopsieDaisy.exe --test
```

Expected output:
```
üê± Oopsie Daisy - File Recovery Tool
‚úÖ Application loaded successfully
‚úÖ Hardware monitor import successful
‚úÖ Recovery engine import successful
‚úÖ UI components import successful
‚úÖ Platform detected: Windows
üéâ All core functionality tests passed!
```

## üß™ Manual Testing Options

### **Option 1: Windows VM (Free)**
- **VirtualBox + Windows 11 VM**: Microsoft provides free Windows 11 VMs for testing
- **Download**: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/
- **License**: 90-day evaluation (renewable)

### **Option 2: GitHub Codespaces**
- Run Windows container in browser
- Limited to command-line testing
- Good for import/dependency verification

### **Option 3: Community Testing**
- **Beta testers**: Recruit Windows users from GitHub community
- **Issue template**: Provide testing checklist
- **Feedback loop**: Quick bug reports and fixes
